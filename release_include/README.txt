Patch Instructions:
    1. Open the included xdeltaUI.exe
    2. In "patch", select the .xdelta patch that matches with your ROM type/region (US V1, EUR, etc).

    4. In "Output File", set up the output ROM name and location.

    3. Select your controller in ToxInput (Must be an Xinput controller)

Crash Reporting Instructions:

DO NOT CLOSE THE GAME before taking a picture of the screen (or a screenshot if you're using an emulator).
When the game crashes, it should display a debug screen automatically, unlike in vanilla SM64DS.
The debug screen contains crucial information that can help us to fix the crash.
Make sure that all numbers on the debug screen are clearly visible in the picture.
Send the picture to pants64 on Discord and describe what happened in-game before the crash.
(That's his exact Discord tag which you can use to add him as a friend if you don't share a server with him.)

Reporting other bugs:

If you notice something in the game that doesn't seem intentional, tell that to pants64 on Discord.
    - That's his exact Discord tag which you can use to add him as a friend if you don't share a server with him.
    - If the issue is hard to describe accurately, sending a screenshot or a picture of the screen might help.
